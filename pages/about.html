        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Our app was developed by two small-time indie devs and designers,
          <strong>Paul</strong> and <strong>Kenson</strong>, who share a passion
          for programming, design, and reselling. To make our tasks more fun, we
          decided to design an app that uses the latest AI modeling and Optical
          Character Recognition (OCR) technology to create algorithms for
          recognizing and pricing video games.
        </p>

        <h2>The Game Pricing Data</h2>
        <p class="prominent">
          The data for pricing the video games is based on the industry
          standard,
          <strong>Pricecharting</strong>, and is extremely reliable for what you
          can expect to get after shipping and handling on sites like
          <strong>eBay</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use It</h2>
        <p>
          At the moment, this app is <strong>free</strong> and we use it
          ourselves to find and buy video games. Here’s how we use it:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We go into thrift shops and video game shops, take photos of video
            games, and quickly get a price estimate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another way is by dragging and dropping photos from
            <strong>Facebook Marketplace</strong>
            into the app to quickly get a price for each game in an entire shelf
            or stack in seconds.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Both methods help us make over <strong>$50 an hour</strong>, and they
          will for you, too! This more than makes up for the small fee that we
          plan to charge soon to cover our costs.
        </p>

        <h2>Interested in Custom Software?</h2>
        <p>
          Video game shops are very interested in our product. If you own a
          shop,
          <a href="mailto:support@gamesighter.com">reach out</a>, and perhaps we
          can build custom software just for you.
